# DGCC : Dynamic Generic C Collections

The project is a library regrouping several generic collections :

- Stack : First In First Out (FIFO)
- Queue : Last In First Out (LIFO)

- Array

# Iterable Collections

This collections are iterable.
Moreover, "foreach loops" have been created for each collection.
